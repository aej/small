Small is a simple blogging application, similar to Medium. It will let users write little blog posts which will all be shared on the main page.

I'm attempting to follow the structure on https://testdriven.io

There will be the following microservices as part of this application:


1. users - manage users and auth
2. client - client-side react app
3. small - application for managing user posts



# TODO:

- setup a gunicorn run script for the application and redefine the entrypoint
